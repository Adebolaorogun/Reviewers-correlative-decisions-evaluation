# Reviewers-correlative-decisions-evaluation
This project is an analysis based on how alike reviewers think when they are investigating the same scenarios. 

The results from this analysis helps us compare the reliablility of each reviewers decision by comparing thier judgement to other reviewers in the same situation.

After getting this analysis done, the team can then decide the next step of actions.
